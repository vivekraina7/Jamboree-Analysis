## Classical ML: Graduate Admission Prediction for Jamboree's IVY League College Feature

1. Developed a predictive model to estimate the probability of graduate admission from an Indian perspective for Jamboree's IVY League College Feature.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between different factors like GRE, TOEFL scores, University ranking, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letter of Recommendation (LOR), and Research Experience.
3. Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
4. Implemented regression models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict the probability of graduate admission.
5. Analyzed the importance of different features using feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination and Lasso Regression.
6. Demonstrated strong skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.
7. This project has practical implications for Jamboree in understanding the factors that affect graduate admissions and can help students to estimate their chances of admission to IVY League colleges.
